          <h3>Gaming</h3>
          <p><b>Gaming is not a skill - it’s a massive collection of skills!</b></p>
          <p>Games are a generic microcosm of life. In all situations there are rules, resources, and goals. In fact, a minor, modern trend is to “gamify” every day things, such as working out, studying, etc. Finding solutions to problems is a game that happens in every day life, so by learning that skill through specific games and gaming, even though simplified, helps you with life in general.</p>

          <h3>Basketball</h3>
          <p>Basketball is one of the simplest sports in the world with the objective being put the ball into the hoop more times than the other team. However, the process in which an individual or team does this is much more complicated than it seems at first glance. Some of the most important skills that are part of the game of basketball include shooting, dribbling, defense, rebounding, and passing. Outside of these basketball-specific skills the need for good athleticism, jumping ability, speed, and stamina are all important skills in the game too.</p>
